# Week 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query
Week 1 was my first hands-on experience with the data analytics process. I learned how important data cleaning and transformation are before any kind of analysis. This week mainly focused on using Power Query and understanding how raw data is prepared for meaningful use. The practical learning helped me see that real-world data is rarely perfect and always needs cleaning before I can analyze it
## Introduction to Power Query
Power Query is the tool used in Power BI for cleaning and transforming data. During this week, I learned that Power Query follows the ETL process:
* Extract – bringing data from different sources
* Transform – cleaning, modifying, and structuring the data
* Load – loading the cleaned data into Power BI for analysis
What I found useful about Power Query is that it allows transformations without writing code, which makes it beginner-friendly while still being very powerful.
