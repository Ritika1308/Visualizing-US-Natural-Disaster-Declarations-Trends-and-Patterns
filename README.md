# Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations 
## Problem Statement
The rise in frequency and intensity of natural disasters has become a major challenge in the disaster preparedness and policy-making arena in the United States. Although there is an ample volume of unutilized raw data relating to natural disasters, this project aims at creating powerful visualization from the FEMA data related to disasters in the country, their trends and high risk regions.
## Data Set Description
The project is informed by four key datasets, each selected from authoritative government sources: FEMA and NOAA. These datasets collectively represent administrative declarations of disasters and scientific event-level observations for a move from mere counts to understanding the patterns, severity, and real-world impact of natural disasters in the United States.
### Disaster Declaration Dataset
This is the primary dataset of the project, as it contains official records of federally declared disasters in the United States. It is mainly used to analyze disaster frequency, affected regions, and government response.
#### Key Columns Used
* FEMA Declaration String, Disaster Number – unique identification of each disaster
* Declaration Type, Declaration Title, Declaration Request Number – classification of disasters
* Declaration Date, FY Declared, Incident Begin & End Date, Disaster Closeout Date – time and duration analysis
* Incident Type, Designated Incident Types – nature of disasters
* IH, IA, PA, HM Programs – type of federal assistance provided
#### Usage and Key Metrics Analysis
* To calculate total disaster declarations and year-wise trends
* To identify disaster-prone states and regions
* To analyze disaster duration and assistance coverage
### Earthquake Dataset
This dataset provides event-level earthquake information and adds scientific depth to the project. It helps in understanding the severity and real-world impact of seismic events.
#### Key Columns Used
* Date, Time, Location Name – timing and event identification
* Latitude, Longitude – mapping earthquake epicenters
* Magnitude, MMI Intensity, Tsunami Indicator, VOL Indicator – severity measurement
* Deaths, Damage (USD) – impact assessment
#### Usage and Key Metrics Analysis
* To classify earthquakes based on severity
* To identify high-risk seismic zones
* To analyze the relationship between magnitude and damage
